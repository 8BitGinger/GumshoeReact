            The Bureau boys with their fancy new Penrose Division werent&apos;
            playing by the Queensbury rules. These spooks, with their flashy
            triangular badges and nervous habits – muttering to their badges
            like cornered rats – were always a step behind me, and somehow a
            step ahead. They lurked in the shadows like phantoms, their presence
            a cold wind chilling the back of your neck right when you thought
            you were hot on the trail.They sure as hell weren&apos;t sharing
            their secrets, and judging by the shifty way they operated, those
            secrets were darker than a moonless night in an alley. One thing for
            sure you better do your best to stay out of their cross-hairs, or
            might be taking a long walk off a short pier. But then again, maybe
            a player could use them to their advantage. After all, the enemy of
            my enemy is my friend, right?
