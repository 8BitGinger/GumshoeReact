              The Block, a pulsating heart of artificial light and whispered
              secrets, housed Neon City&apos;s crown jewels â€“ the casinos. Here,
              towering chrome and glass structures, each more opulent than the
              last, jostled for dominance, their neon signs a cacophony of
              clashing colors vying for your attention.
              <br />
              Step through the velvet ropes and enter a world where time melts
              away like a cheap dice roll. Marble floors gleamed under the harsh
              glare of chandeliers, reflecting the desperation and hope
              flickering in the eyes of the patrons. Croupiers, men and women
              with faces as impassive as poker chips, presided over tables
              draped in green felt, their practiced patter a constant white
              noise against the clinking of coins and the whirring of roulette
              wheels.

              &quot;Numbers&quot; Norton: A wizened old man with a mind sharper
              than a broken bottle, Numbers isn&apos;t your typical casino
              patron. He doesn&apos;t gamble, he analyzes. Everyone believe
              Numbers is a genius, others a paranoid recluse obsessed with
              patterns. The truth likely lies somewhere in between.

              Esmeralda &quot;The Duchess&quot; Diaz: A woman who oozes glamour
              and danger in equal measure, With a past as murky as the bootleg
              liquor she once peddled, she&apos;s climbed the ranks from
              alluring showgirl to the casino&apos;s iron-fisted boss.
              Esmeralda&apos;s smile can disarm a gunman, but her ice-cold stare
              can freeze a room.

              &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano Moretti: A wiry card shark with a grin
              as crooked as his dice throws, Lucky Luciano is a legend in The
              Block. He first appeared in Neon City ten years ago, a penniless
              drifter with nothing but a deck of cards and a gambler&apos;s
              spirit. He&apos;s gifted, but his loyalties lie with himself.

            Gambling Can be handled many different ways. Here some approaches I
            have taken:
            <br />
            -Luck Rolls. Base each game, hand, or spin on a Luck roll.
            <br />
            -Casino Game generators. You can use online resources like Casino
            game generators or online card games to simulate the gambling
            experience.
            <br />
            -Real Games. You can actually get a deck of cards out, some dice, or
            even a roulette wheel. The only limit is your imagination
