          Rain hammered the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon symphony outside
          into a watercolor of sin. The dame in the red dress had been gone for
          five years, swallowed by something from the sky. Or so I thought. The
          postcard, yellowed with age and travel, was a tangible ghost: her
          familiar scrawl whispering promises from a city that shimmered with
          both chrome and sleaze - Neon City, a city of glitz and vice carved
          from the rocky coast. A city that had swallowed men whole.

          But whispers tell of her murder â€“ a death she seem to have cheated
          once before, somehow, but couldn&apos;t again. Now, amidst the crooked
          cops and ruthless gangsters of this 1930s underworld, you arrive to
          find yourself entangled in a mystery far stranger than you imagined.
          Secret agents from the clandestine Penrose Division,
          prohibition-flouting speakeasies, and the seductive thrum of jazz
          clubs form the backdrop of your search for the truth about who killed
          your lover and the identity of the mysterious agents following you.

          But even the city&apos;s dazzling lights can&apos;t mask the dark
          secrets it holds. Your only hope seems to be Frank Hodgkins, a haggard
          and perpetually-drunk detective with a gruff exterior and a
          surprisingly noble sense of morality. Though his cynicism runs deep,
          the glint of determination in his bloodshot eyes hints at a past that
          fuels his refusal to turn a blind eye to the city&apos;s corruption.

          Another ally comes in the form of Ruby Dubois, a young, aspiring jazz
          singer with a voice as smooth as velvet and eyes that beamed with
          curiosity. Her dreams of the spotlight intertwine with yours as she
          too longs to unravel the mysteries that threaten to consume Neon City.
          Her reasons may remain unclear, but her loyalty is unwavering.
