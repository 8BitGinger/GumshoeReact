But just like a jazz solo, too many bars and it turns into a cacophony, too few and you lose the rhythm. Finding the sweet spot for fisticuffs depends on your story, a delicate dance between the players and the perils you throw their way."
        content2="Turn order starts with whoever initiates combat. It is then clockwise around the table. When it gets to the Story Teller he will roll for the NPC's."

            DEATH AND INJURY
            <br />
            Here a bad decision can leave you stiffer than a rigged poker deck.
            Here is how Death and Injury work in Gumshoe:
            <br />
            If a player reaches 0 HP they are considered incapacitated.
            <br />
            If they reach -5 HP they are considered mortally wounded and will
            die in 1D4 rounds, unless attended to.
            <br />
            If they reach -10 HP they are considered dead.
            <br />
            They can be healed with Medical Skill Checks or First Aid Kits.
          </p>
