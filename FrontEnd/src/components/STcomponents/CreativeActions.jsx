          Creative actions can be handled in a variety of ways. Let&apos;s say
          the player wants to shoot down a banner to trap the gangster instead
          of the other examples given.
          <br />
          Instead of rolling a complex series of rolls for example:
          <br />
          ‚öî Attack Roll for Shot
          <br />
          üëÅ Perception Check for Banner
          <br />
          ‚òò Luck Roll for Banner to fall etc...
          <br />
        </p>
      </article>
      <p className="column card">
        You could simplify it by having the player roll a Percent Roll.
        <br />
        The difficulty value will be determined by Story Teller on a 1-100
        scale.
        <br />
        ‚óè 1-10 Being very easy <br />
        ‚óè 100 being nearly impossible
        <br />
        So if you decide it&apos;s fairly difficult and assign a value of 75.
        Then player would roll their Percent Dice (2D10 or 1D100) and any of
        their Luck Points they wish to Apply.
        <br />
        If they succeed the banner falls and the gangster is trapped.
        <br />
        If they fail the banner doesn&apos;t fall and the gangster gets away.
        <br />
        It can be as simple as that!
