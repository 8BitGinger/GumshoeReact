        content='The key is knowing your audience. Seasoned gumshoes can sniff out a red herring from a mile away, so you gotta get creative with your misdirection. Plant false leads that shimmer with possibility, dead ends that feel tantalizingly close to the truth. But remember, there&apos;s a fine line between challenge and confusion. A good mystery is a puzzle, not an enigma. So, dole out the clues with a steady hand, whispers in the night, a cryptic inscription on a crumpled matchbook. Let your players connect the dots, their "Aha!" moments sweeter for the struggle.'

      <LeftCard content="Because in the end, the thrill of the chase is half the fun. Just make sure they have enough moonlight to follow the trail, but not enough to see the whole picture at once. That's where the real magic happens, in the shadowy space between knowing and not knowing, where your players become detectives, not just pawns on your twisted game board." />

      <h2>Discovering Clues</h2>

      <LeftCard
        content="You will have to present clues for the players to follow. It's a
          tough balance to find the right difficulty level for your clues,
          hidden items, and red herrings. Nothing hurts more than your players
          completely unable to solve or progress the game and it's very
          frustrating for them to have everything handed to them. Work with your
          players to find the right balance. Every Investigation gives the
          players a Clue Token. After collecting 4 Tokens the players can cash
          them in to get a piece of the bigger picture!"

            Don&apos;t forget the Red Herring. Red Herrings are clues
            specifically designed to point the player in the WRONG direction.
            They can be fun and add a lot of depth to your story, but be careful
            not to overuse them. They can be very frustrating for your players.
