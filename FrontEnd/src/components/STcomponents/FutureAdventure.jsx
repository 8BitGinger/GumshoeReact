          Rain slicked the chrome of my trench coat, the neon glow of Neon City
          bleeding into the puddles like spilled dreams. This dame, long gone
          and presumed dead, had resurfaced on a flimsy postcard. Her message, a
          cryptic plea for help, tugged at the ghost of what we once had. Neon
          City. A rocky hideaway where pleasure and peril intertwined like
          vipers in a heat haze. I wasn&apos;t built for sunshine and sand, my
          skills honed in the shadows of steel canyons. But a dame in distress?
          That&apos;s a case I couldn&apos;t walk away from.

          The smog hung heavy over Tinseltown, a sickly yellow halo above the
          hazy dreamscape. Here, ambition dripped like sweat under the merciless
          California sun, where fortunes were made and shattered faster than a
          celluloid kiss. Dames with million-dollar smiles hawked their wares,
          and chisel-jawed fellas with steely gazes dreamt of the silver screen.
          But beneath the glitz, a darkness festered. Whispers slithered through
          back alleys, tales of things unnatural, of creatures from beyond the
          frame. Hollywoodland, they called it. More like Hollyweirdland, a
          place where the scripts got stranger than anything dreamed up by a
          drunken screenwriter. You, chum, are the only shamus with the guts
          (and the bottle) to wade through this celluloid nightmare.

          The Amazon humidity hung heavy in Rio, a suffocating cloak over the
          vibrant chaos. Christ the Redeemer, its skeletal form reaching towards
          the hazy sky, offered no solace. Here, in 1936 Rio, the samba pulsed
          with a darker rhythm. I, a weary gumshoe used to the grit of Neon
          City, had arrived for some sun-drenched R&amp;R. But past sins are
          like stray bullets, they have a way of finding you, even in paradise.
          A face from a forgotten case materialized across the casino floor â€“
          Frankie &quot;The Fox&quot; Moretti, the brother of a man I once
          killed. He shouldn&apos;t be here, breathing, radiating barely
          contained rage. Looks like my Rio vacation just took a sharp turn into
          a labyrinth of showgirls with deadly secrets, a murder threatening to
          ignite a war, and Frankie &quot;The Fox&quot; Moretti thirsting for
          revenge as cold as a Rio night. This dame in distress wouldn&apos;t be
          wearing a swimsuit, but a shroud.

          Moscow, a frozen tomb bathed in perpetual twilight. Not exactly your
          typical tourist trap. You, a gumshoe with a nose for trouble and a
          taste for cheap vodka, were partnered with Nika Arovka, a Soviet
          ambassador with a smile too sharp and eyes like glacial ice. Whispers
          of strange men in uniforms and ancient alien devices with world-ending
          power sent you both hurtling through this frozen hell. Tracked once
          again by the Mysterious Penrose Division: you, a down-on-your-luck
          detective, and a femme fatale with buried secrets, were all that stood
          between oblivion and a world cracked open like a rotten egg.

          The last case went sideways faster than a greased getaway car. Now,
          you find yourself yanked from the familiar grime and grit and
          deposited in... well, who even knows? The Penrose Division,
          that&apos;s what they call themselves. Seems this rabbit hole runs
          deeper than a bootleg speakeasy. Multiverse travel, alternate
          realities, alien threats, the whole kit and kaboodle. All under the
          steely gaze of your new boss, April Sunday. A dame with a name that
          wouldn&apos;t be out of place in a bygone era, stuck in a world that
          makes yesterday&apos;s case look like a walk in the park. One
          thing&apos;s for sure, shamus: the gloves are off. Crack the case with
          the help of your new partner Nika Arovka, stop whatever&apos;s
          bleeding through the seams of reality, and maybe, just maybe, impress
          Ms. Sunday enough to learn the mystery that started this whole
          adventure!
