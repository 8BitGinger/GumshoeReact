          So, your players have cracked the case, tangled with the Rusty Spikes,
          and maybe even gotten their hands on a souped-up Skylark. Here&apos;s
          where you crank the neon to eleven and unleash the real mind-blower.
          <br />
          <br />
          Maybe that pulsating billboard wasn&apos;t advertising a new brand of
          cigarettes, but a message from a visitor from outerspace. The
          possibilities are as limitless as the neon sky.
          <br />
          <br />
          Leave your players blinking, bewildered, and maybe even a little
          heartbroken (in the best way possible) when they finally hang up their
          Fedoras for the long night!
