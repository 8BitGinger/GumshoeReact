          Rain hammered the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon symphony outside
          into a watercolor of sin. The dame in the red dress had been gone for
          five years, swallowed by something from the sky. Or so I thought. The
          postcard, yellowed with age and travel, was a tangible ghost: her
          familiar scrawl whispering promises from a city that shimmered with
          both chrome and sleaze - Neon City, a city of glitz and vice carved
          from the rocky coast. A city that had swallowed men whole.

        But whispers tell of her murder â€“ a death she seem to have cheated once
        before, somehow, but couldn&apos;t again. Now, amidst the crooked cops
        and ruthless gangsters of this 1930s underworld, you arrive to find
        yourself entangled in a mystery far stranger than you imagined. Secret
        agents from the clandestine Penrose Division, prohibition-flouting
        speakeasies, and the seductive thrum of jazz clubs form the backdrop of
        your search for the truth about who killed your lover and the identity
        of the mysterious agents following you.

        But even the city&apos;s dazzling lights can&apos;t mask the dark
        secrets it holds. Your only hope seems to be Frank Hodgkins, a haggard
        and perpetually-drunk detective with a gruff exterior and a surprisingly
        noble sense of morality. Though his cynicism runs deep, the glint of
        determination in his bloodshot eyes hints at a past that fuels his
        refusal to turn a blind eye to the city&apos;s corruption.

        You will be pursued by Agents of the Mysterious Penrose Division of the
        FBI. Their goals and interests unknown, they seem to be stalking your
        every move. They are a force to be reckoned with and will stop at
        nothing to keep you from uncovering the truth.

        Together, you&apos;ll navigate the neon-drenched labyrinth, armed with
        your wits, a flicker of impossible hope, and the unlikely alliance of a
        washed-up detective and a fiery songbird, all to unravel a conspiracy
        that twists the very fabric of reality. <br />
